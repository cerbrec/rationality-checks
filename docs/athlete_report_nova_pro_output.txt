ATHLETE PERFORMANCE REPORT
================================================================================

BASIC INFORMATION:
School: Corner Canyon (Utah)
Class: 2025
Position: QB – Dual Threat
Size: 6'0", 190 lbs

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
40-yard: 4.72 sec
Shuttle: 4.31 sec
Vertical: 31"
Bench Press: 235 lbs

GRIT PROFILE:
Type: Silent Assassin
Description: Leads with presence, not noise. Low ego, high fire. Consistent, locked-in, and calm in chaos. Doesn't need to talk—his tape does that for him.

ANALYSIS:

Helaman, you're not just explosive on the field—you're a field general with elite spatial awareness, quick-twitch decision-making, and the ability to stay cool when the pressure rises. You don't flinch when things break down. You read it. React. Extend. Strike.What sets you apart isn't just mobility or mechanics—it's the way you think. The way you anticipate. You play like someone who's already watched the game before it happened.

You’re among the rare <2 % of high school players whose measurables align with collegiate-level prospects. Division I programs, especially in FBS, are the most likely fit: they offer up to 85 full scholarships (head-count) and are beginning to shift to more flexible models that may open even more opportunities starting in 2025. Division I FCS is another viable path, with up to 63 full scholarship equivalents that can be divided among more players.Division II remains on the table as well, offering up to 36 equivalency scholarships that coaches often slice into partial awards—useful for multifaceted players like you. Division III—and those Ivy League or Pioneer League FCS schools—don’t offer athletic scholarships and rely solely on academic or need-based aid

Here’s how we’ll separate you from the competition: by amplifying those elite measurables, sharpening your pre-snap reads and anticipation, and crafting high-impact film that demonstrates your elite de...
