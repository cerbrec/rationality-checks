At least 60 kilometres of Queensland's southeastern shore were contaminated when at least 42 tonnes of oil spilled into the ocean from MV Pacific Adventurer on Wednesday night.  The ship, which had sailed into cyclonic weather, lost 31 containers aboard, one of which pierced the ship's hull and a fuel tank.  Anna Bligh, the Queensland premier, has declared Moreton Island, Bribie Island and southern parts of the Sunshine Coast disaster zones.",
